Vadoxibot is a **Powershell** script for Runescape clan leaders that makes it easy to track their clanmates and ranks via **Discord**.

### Who is this for?
This script was created for clans who only use a player's Clan XP for ranks. The data is scraped from Runescape's Hiscores API to be accurate, instantaneous, and relevant at all times. Once a criteria is met, the script posts the output to Discord.

## Getting Started
* Determine which Discord channel the bot should post within
* Create a Webhook within that channel's settings
* Modify a few variables at the top of the script
* Let Vadoxibot do the rest!

## Notification Features
* Name change
* New player joins the clan
* Existing player leaves the clan
* Clanmate promoted / demoted
* Clanmate is due a promotion *(based on XP)*

## Recommended Requirements
* Windows 10 & Powershell
* Reliable, 24/7 internet connection
